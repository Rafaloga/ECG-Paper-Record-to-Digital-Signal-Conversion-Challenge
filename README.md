This repository holds the code and resources for the ECG image processing and digitization challenge.
This project involves developing an image processing algorithm using \textit{OpenCV} or similar libraries to convert ECG paper records into digital signals. The process includes image preprocessing to enhance quality, extracting ECG traces from various layouts, and digitizing these traces. The provided dataset contains diverse ECG paper record images. The solution encompasses reading, preprocessing, segmentation, and digitization, enabling the conversion of paper records into digital ECG data.

Directory Structure
code/: Here, you'll find Jupyter Notebooks detailing the various project stages:

Image Preprocessing: Initial step for raw ECG image enhancement.
